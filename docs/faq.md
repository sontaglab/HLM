# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Common parser errors

- **`Failed to parse Verilog: Unable to locate module header`** — Ensure the
  file contains a `module ... ( ... );` declaration with matching `endmodule`.
- **`Only single-output modules are supported`** — HLM currently targets NOR2
  trees with one output; split multi-output designs into separate modules.
- **`Expression references undeclared signal(s)`** — Declare each identifier as an
  input or rename it to match the canonical port list.

## Tree reconstruction issues

- **`Mismatch between connector count and child nodes`** — The ASCII graph from
  the MATLAB dataset may be truncated. Regenerate the dataset or verify the
  specific row in `summary.mat`.
- **`Could not resolve gate counts for all nodes`** — Indicates a malformed tree
  where the recursive gate counting loop never converges. Inspect the canonical
  entry in MATLAB to confirm consistency.

## Netlist rendering pitfalls

- **`Gate node 'g_X' has N fan-in; only NOR2 is supported`** — The canonical tree
  includes more than two children for a node. This suggests data corruption;
  consider trimming the offending child or regenerating the canonical template.
- **`Tree references input index N, but module only has M input(s)`** — The
  behavioural Verilog module declares fewer inputs than expected by the canonical
  permutation. Double-check the port list or re-run the truth-table mapping.

## Integrating with other toolchains

- Use the structural netlists generated by `render_structural_verilog` as inputs
  to downstream synthesis or simulation flows. Because they are pure NOR2
  networks, most EDA tools can process them immediately.
- To experiment with variations, modify the ASCII graph tables in `matlab/` and
  rebuild the docs so new plots appear automatically.

Still stuck? Inspect the source for `HybridDataError` exceptions — these include
contextual hints about which stage detected inconsistent data.
